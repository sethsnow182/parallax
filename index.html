        <h2>What Is Parallax Effect?</h2>
        <p>Parallax effect involves a web pageâ€™s background moving at a slower rate than the foreground. This creates an illusion
        of depth to the page, giving the content a 3D effect as viewers scroll down.</p>

        <h2>What Are the Benefits of Using a Parallax Effect?</h2>
        <p>There are a number of benefits to using a parallax effect on your WordPress website. The first, and most obvious, is the
        visual aspect of a parallax effect. A parallax effect is aesthetically pleasing, giving your website a fresh, stylish
        and modern look and feel. This wow effect can make your content really pop, and creates an exciting and interesting
        browser experience.</p>

        <h2>Parallax on Mobile?</h2>
        <p>While parallax is great for adding visual interest, it does not always work well on mobile devices. Because phones and
        tablets typically use swipe navigation (instead of a scroll like desktops) parallax effects may not render correctly. Of
        course, this will depend on the method and animations you use for your own parallax section, however for good usability
        you may want to consider disabling parallax on devices. </p>
